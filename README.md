### Description
This use case will focus on the use of HoloLens for helping to teach job skills to people with autism, particularly those aging out of
the supports provided in the school environment. Unemployment for those with autism is significant and the supports in the work
environment are limited. The use case will use HoloLens augmented reality to help with basic job skills by presenting a visual cues
on how to complete task such as stocking shelves or preparing food. This scenario should also address the issue of moving away
from 1:1 support to a 1:n as an a student becomes an adult.

Hackathon Objective Create a HoloLens demo based on a common work scenario demonstrating the visual “activity schedule” which the subject can see
while working.

Open Source Objective Build a baseline of code demonstrating the scenario so others can extend it by adding new scenarios and potentially use the code
for a commercial solution in the space

### Installing the Emulator 

Download the HoloLens Emulator.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-the-hololens-emulator) to run the emulator on your machine

### Starter Tutorial 
To kick start this hackathon we will begin with this simple project. 
[Build your first HoloLens 2 Application with Unity](https://arvrjourney.com/build-your-first-hololens-2-application-with-unity-and-mrtk-2-3-0-5f431d8cca8)

####  Pre Reqs

- A Windows 10 computer
- [Visual Studio 2019 community version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) installed with ‘Desktop development with C++’ and ‘Universal Windows Platform (UWP) development’. You can tick these two workloads during the installation process.
- A HoloLens 2 device (or you can use the emulator - shown above)
- Unity Hub with Unity 2019.3.X installed and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Again you can tick this module (UWP) during the installation process)
- Unity Mixed reality Tool Kit (MRTK) version 2.3.0 — [Download from here](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/download/v2.3.0/Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Unity.Foundation.2.3.0.unitypackage).
